# minor-project

Hi there! Welcome to our minor project for semester 5.
So, our aim is basically to develop an app that will help reduce the waste of extra food left during parties and functions and can be used to feed the needy who sleep hungry on the streets of our country. We'll provide a channel between the host of a party and an NGO that focuses on "zero hunger", which is a United Nations SDG. This will be an initiative to reduce the wastage of tonnes of food and distribute it to those in need.
Thanks for giving this a read. We hope you'll like the initiative.
