# SustainDine

Hi there! Welcome to our project "SustainDine"
This app aims to reduce the food wastage in our country by providing a channel between extra food left at parties/functions and NGOs responsible for providing food to the needy who sleep hungry on the streets of our country. This project tries to solve the problem of "Zero Hunger", a United Nations Sustainable Developmental Goal(SDG).

This is a full stack app developed using MongoDb, ExpressJs, React Native and NodeJs.

To run on mobile phone(android/iOS):
1. Install Expo in your phone.
2. Run npm install in terminal.
3. Move to App directory and type "npx expo start".
