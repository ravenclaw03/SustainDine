# SustainDine

Hi there! Welcome to our project "SustainDine"
This app aims to reduce the food wastage in our country by providing a channel between extra food left at parties/functions and NGOs responsible for providing food to the needy who sleep hungry on the streets of our country. This project tries to solve the problem of "Zero Hunger", a United Nations Sustainable Developmental Goal(SDG).

This is a full stack app developed using MongoDb, ExpressJs, React Native and NodeJs.

To run on mobile phone(android/iOS):
1. Install Expo in your phone.
2. Run npm install in terminal.
3. Move to App directory and type "npx expo start".
4. Scan Qr code through Expo to access the app. 

How it works.
1. Donor creates a request to donate surplus food , providing certain details regarding it.
2. NGO accepts an available request.
3. Delivery person accepts an available request which has been accepted by a NGO and delivers the food from donor to NGO.
4. The actors can access each others details.
